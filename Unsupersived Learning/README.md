## The goal of the project is to implement distinct Machine Learning (ML) approaches and methods to address a specific problem using a public dataset

## Clustering
- Define the business goal to be achieved
- Present the data selection criteria
- Explain how the data was prepared
- Apply and evaluate the K-Means algorithm
- Optimize the algorithm parameters
- Document the intermediate and final results

## Association Rules
- Define the business goal to be achieved
- Present the data selection criteria
- Describe the data preparation steps
- Apply and evaluate the Apriori algorithm, adjusting the algorithm parameters
- Document the intermediate and final results
